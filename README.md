## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Get Started in 2 Steps

1.  **Start the development environment:**
    The `setup` command builds the containers, runs database migrations, and prepares the `.env` file.
    ```bash
    make setup
    ```

2.  **Access your application:**
    The initial setup automatically creates a superuser for you:
    - **Username:** `admin`
    - **Password:** `admin123`

    You can now access the main endpoints:
    - **API Docs:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/)
    - **Admin:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)
    - **Health:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Commands

All commands are executed via `make`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | üöÄ **Initial setup:** builds containers, runs migrations, and creates a default superuser. |
| `make up` | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Starts all services in the background. |
| `make down` | ‚¨áÔ∏è Stops all services. |
| `make test` | üß™ Runs the full test suite with coverage report. |
| `make quality` | ‚úÖ Runs all code quality checks (lint, format, types, tests). |
| `make shell` | üêö Opens a Django shell inside the running container. |
| `make superuser` | üë§ Creates a new, interactive superuser. |
| `make logs` | üìã Tails the logs for all running services. |
| `make help` | ‚ùì Shows all available commands. |

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **`src/apps/`**: Contains the different business domains of the application. Each app is a self-contained module.
- **`src/healthcoreapi/`**: Holds the project-level configuration, including settings, URL routing, and ASGI/WSGI entrypoints.
- **Service Layer**: Business logic is encapsulated in services, decoupled from Django's views.
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted through repositories, making it easy to switch data sources and mock for tests.

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

This template is configured with a comprehensive quality suite.

Run all checks with a single command:
```bash
make quality
```

This command executes:
- **`pytest`**: For unit and integration tests.
- **`ruff`**: For code formatting and linting.
- **`mypy`**: For static type checking.
- **`bandit` & `safety`**: For security vulnerability scanning.

## üöÄ Production & Deployment

This project is configured for production deployment using Docker.

The `docker-compose.prod.yml` file orchestrates the `nginx` and `django` services for a production environment.

**To deploy to production:**

1.  Ensure your production `.env` file is configured with your domain, secrets, and `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=healthcoreapi.settings.production`.
2.  Build and run the production containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
    ```

This will start the application served by Nginx, ready to handle production traffic.
