# ADR-0007: Terraform for Infrastructure as Code on Azure

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-22

## Context

To achieve repeatable, version-controlled, and automated deployments to our target cloud environment (Azure), we must manage our infrastructure using an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach. This prevents manual configuration drift, enables disaster recovery, and integrates seamlessly into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Decision

We will adopt **Terraform** as our IaC tool for provisioning and managing all cloud resources on Microsoft Azure.

Our initial infrastructure scope will include:
1.  An Azure Resource Group to contain all project resources.
2.  An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster as our container orchestration platform.
3.  Dependencies for AKS, such as a Log Analytics Workspace for monitoring.

The Terraform code will reside in the `terraform/` directory in the root of the repository. We will use a remote backend (e.g., Azure Storage Account) to store the Terraform state, enabling collaboration and use in CI/CD.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Automation and Repeatability:** Infrastructure deployments will be fully automated and consistent across all environments.
- **Version Control:** The entire infrastructure is defined in code, which can be versioned in Git, reviewed, and audited.
- **Cloud Agnostic (in principle):** While our provider is Azure, Terraform's declarative syntax and provider model make it easier to manage multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud scenarios in the future.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem:** Terraform is the industry standard for IaC with extensive documentation and community support.

**Negative:**
- **Learning Curve:** Requires team members to be proficient in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) and Terraform concepts.
- **State Management:** The Terraform state file is a critical component that must be managed carefully to avoid corruption or security issues. Using a remote, locked backend is non-negotiable.
